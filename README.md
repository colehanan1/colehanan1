## 👋 About Me

I'm a biomedical ML and robotics researcher at **Washington University in St. Louis**, focusing on the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. My work explores how biological neural circuits—particularly from *Drosophila* connectomes—can inspire more efficient and adaptable artificial learning systems.

**Current Research Focus:**
- 🦟 Leveraging *Drosophila* whole-brain connectomes for bio-inspired neural architectures
- 🔄 Developing plasticity-guided learning algorithms with dopamine-modulated mechanisms
- 🤖 Deploying edge AI for closed-loop behavioral control systems
- 📊 Building computational tools for neuroscience data analysis

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### [Plasticity-Guided Connectome Network (PGCN)](https://github.com/colehanan1/Plasticity-Guided-Connectome-Network-PGCN)
A bio-inspired recurrent neural network that combines *Drosophila* connectome constraints with valence-modulated plasticity. This novel approach uses reservoir computing with realistic circuit structures for innate odor processing pathways, enhanced by learnable dopamine-gated mechanisms.

**Key Features:**
- 🧬 Biologically constrained network topology from real connectome data
- 🎯 Dopamine-modulated synaptic plasticity for reward-based learning
- ⚡ Efficient reservoir computing architecture
- 🔬 Applications in understanding insect olfactory learning

### [DoOR Python Toolkit](https://github.com/colehanan1/door-python-toolkit)
Python tools for working with the Database of Odorant Responses (DoOR), enabling researchers to access and analyze comprehensive odor response data across multiple species.

### [FlyBehaviorScoring](https://github.com/colehanan1/FlyBehaviorScoring)
Automated behavioral analysis system for quantifying and scoring *Drosophila* behaviors in closed-loop experimental setups.
